**Stop overthinking. Start doing.**

WheelDo is a task management app that keeps you focused on one thing at a time. When you can't decide what to tackle
next, just spin the wheel and let it choose for you.

## The Problem

We've all been there. You sit down to be productive, open your to-do list, and... freeze. Too many tasks. Too many
priorities. You spend more time deciding what to do than actually doing it. And when you finally start something,
another task catches your eye, and suddenly you're juggling three things at once—finishing none of them.

This is decision fatigue. This is the multitasking trap. And it's killing your productivity.

## The Solution

WheelDo takes a different approach. You can only work on **one task at a time**. No more tab-switching madness. No
more "I'll just quickly do this other thing." When you commit to a task, you commit.

And when you genuinely can't decide what to start? Spin the wheel. It's fun, it's random, and it gets you moving instead
of staring at your list.

## Features

### One Task at a Time

The core philosophy. When you start a task, it's pinned at the top of your list. Want to switch? You'll need to
consciously defer it first. This simple constraint eliminates multitasking chaos and keeps you focused.

### Spin the Wheel

Can't decide what to do next? Filter by how much time you have, then spin the wheel. Let fate pick your next task. It's
surprisingly liberating (and honestly kind of fun).

### Smart Task Details

Add as much or as little detail as you need:

- Duration estimates so the wheel knows what fits your schedule
- Location with smart autocomplete
- Effort level tracking
- Flexible deadlines
- Recurring tasks with full calendar-style options

### Task Dependencies

Some tasks need to happen before others. Create parent-child relationships to keep related work organized. Child tasks
stay blocked until the parent is done.

### Task Sharing

Working with others? Invite collaborators to specific tasks. Everyone stays on the same page with notifications for
updates and changes.

### Categories and Organization

Organize your tasks into categories like Work, Personal, Health, Finance, or Home. Create your own categories with
custom colors that match how you think about your life.

### Deadline Alerts

Never miss a deadline. Task cards change color as due dates approach—from calm to yellow to orange to red. You'll know
at a glance what needs attention.

### Notifications

Stay in the loop. Get notified when someone updates a shared task, when deadlines are approaching, or when collaborators
make changes.

### Works Everywhere

Install WheelDo on your phone or desktop as a Progressive Web App. It feels like a native app without the app store
hassle.

### Theme Customization

Make it yours. Choose a color theme that fits your style and makes you actually want to open your task list.

## How It Works

1. **Sign in** with your GitHub account (quick, secure, no new password to remember)
2. **Add your tasks** with as much or as little detail as you want
3. **Pick your next task** from the list—or spin the wheel if you're feeling indecisive
4. **Complete it** and enjoy the confetti celebration (you earned it)

That's it. No complex workflows. No learning curve. Just you, your tasks, and a wheel that's got your back when you need
it.

## Who Is This For?

- **Overthinkers** who spend more time planning than doing
- **Busy professionals** drowning in their never-ending to-do list
- **Teams** who need to share and collaborate on specific tasks
- **Anyone** who's ever stared at their task list, completely unable to start

If you've ever wished someone would just tell you what to do next, WheelDo is for you. Except instead of someone, it's a
wheel. And honestly? The wheel doesn't judge.

---

- Start by adding 5-10 tasks you've been putting off

- When you're stuck, don't overthink it—just spin
- Celebrate your wins (the confetti is there for a reason)
